# App Store clone in react-native

This sample project was intended to demonstrate the possibilities with react-native.

 - [x] TabBar
 - [x] Today list headings
 - [x] Card Shared Element transition
 - [ ] Card list of apps
 - [ ] Card app components (GET button, etc.)
 - [ ] Card detail lazy loading
 - [ ] Search list
 - [ ] Search input field focus transition
 - [ ] Navigation title transition (ex. Games to App detail)
 - [ ] App list horizontal scroll
 - [ ] App detail horizontal scroll
 - [ ] Categories view
 - [ ] Updates list of apps

## Hard Problems

 - Navbar title fade away when scrolled.
 - Allow shared elements to transition outside Safe Area constraints.
 - Animate width and height properally in an controlled animated environment.
 - Horizontal scroll view with next and previous slides peeking through.
 - Animated spinner

## Why

It's fun.

## Goal

Have a sample app on the AppStore that replicates Apple's AppStore. Apple will probably never allow this unless we change the app content to something that will be clearly distinguishable from Apple's own AppStore.
